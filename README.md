To introduce myself and showcase some of the work I've done, I created this portfolio using React.

![PortHome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63235971/115593033-e6d96600-a2cb-11eb-86e0-9e1d59047211.jpg)

I wanted to keep the design fairly simple, with a landing page that explains what's happening. I implimented a nice horizontal scrolling effect between pages on the nav bar.
For the color scheme I was feeling quite summer-ry, so I created a CSS gradient with colors taken from a picture of a sunset. Like anyone else I would usually gravitate towards a
black or white background, however because this website won't have too many other images on it, it shouldn't end up looking too busy.

The about page is very simple too, for the tech stack icons I added a color change on hover. The information on this page may be expanded in future.

For the projects page, I added gifs of my projects in a working condition. On hover I created a card that has a title, a very brief description and a link to the github repo.

The responsive design isn't quite finished- I designed a new nav bar, so when the media breakpoint is hit the original one disappears and is replaced by the mobile one at the bottom of the page.

I've decided to add a Photography page to my portfolio. While it isn't strictly relevant to Web Design, I have a degree in Photography and I thought by putting some of my pictures into my project I could give a better insight into my creative style. I chose a sample of photos that don't require mcuh additional context.

This has led me to think about the overall colour-scheme: I really like the pink-sunset gradient but it has made coordinating additional assets a struggle, and that becomes clearer when introducing my photos. Once the gallery is in place I'll be trying some new colour schemes out.
